<p>Crane Brewing Company is focused on three styles, Saison, Berliner Weiss and Lambic. No matter what styles, hybrids or experiments we pursue in the future, these styles will be at the heart of our efforts and output. We believe that these three styles are the foundations upon which we can place a variety of hops, wild yeast, souring bacteria, wood-aging, spices, fruit, and specialty malt.  We see a desire for more beer of these styles, and we promise to challenge your expectation of what these styles can offer in relation to seasonality and flavor combinations. While we will distribute four standard versions of these styles year-round in 750 mL bottles and kegs, we will offer brewery-only special releases and one-off experimental batches throughout the year. </p>

				<p>The beer that made Michael Crane famous is an earthy, zinger that pairs great with food. Our Fall seasonal Berliner-style weiss combines a sour German wheat beer with an unlikely vegetable, and, frankly, they look really good together.</p>
