He brewed as a hobby that occupied his time and brought his family together. Eventually it would bring Michael into a larger community of homebrewers. Michael brewed what those around him enjoyed, focusing on the exotic brews that grabbed the attention of the beer nerds that gathered to discuss homebrewing once a month. He gained notoriety as he branched outside his local competitions and won awards nationally. Finally, he met the home brewers who would lead him to brewing as a career.</p></li>

Chris has enjoyed using his business and laboratory experience in developing the brewery.</p></li>
